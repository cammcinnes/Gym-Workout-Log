# Strength Workouts

## Proposal

This application will allow users to log their workouts in sequential order. The 
user will be able to input a **date**, a **duration** and a **description** for every workout. 

It will be utilized by users looking to:
 - Keep track of their progress throughout there fitness journey
 - Develop a library of workouts 
 - Create the opportunity for reflection 
 
I am interested in this project because I am a triathlete, who is looking to gain more strength throughout 
this upcoming season, but I have not found a program that tracks my workouts in the gym that is simple, 
and I enjoy using. This application will allow me to create a tracker that contains everything necessary 
without the added bells and whistles that begin to complicate things.
